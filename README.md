# The Journal of Open Source Education

The [Journal of Open Source Education](http://jose.theoj.org) (JOSE, tentative name) is a journal for open educational software and open-source educational content.

JOSE is a sibling journal to the [Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org) (JOSS), which publishes open research software. 
JOSE relies on the journal management infrastructure and tools developed for JOSS.

JOSE publishes two types of (brief) articles that describe:

 1. open educational software 
 
 2. open-source educational materials

### Why is this journal needed?

Currently, academia lacks a mechanism for crediting efforts to develop software for assisting teaching and learning or open-source educational content. As a result, beyond personal motivation, there is little incentive to develop and share such material.

The Journal of Open Source Education (JOSE) is a scholarly journal with a formal peer review process designed to _improve the quality of the software or content submitted_. Upon acceptance into JOSE, a CrossRef DOI is minted and we list your paper on the JOSE website.

### What do you mean by "open-source educational materials"?

`TODO`

We do *not* mean openly available slides, lecture notes, or YouTube videos, though these may be acceptable as supplementary materials.


### Scope

`TODO`

We consider submissions from all areas of academia, although our computational focus may result in more natural submissions from STEM fieldsâ€”but all are welcome!

## The team

The editorial board includes:
 - Lorena Barba, editor-in-chief
 - Katy Huff
 - Jason Moore
 - Kyle Niemeyer
 - Anthony Scopatz
 - Tracy Teal

Advisors to the journal include:
 - Carly Strasser

## The site

## Code of Conduct

In order to ensure an open and welcoming community, JOSE adheres to a code of conduct adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

Please adhere to this code of conduct in any interactions you have in the JOSS community. It is strictly enforced on all official JOSE repositories, the JOSE website, and resources. If you encounter someone violating these terms, please let the Editor-in-Chief ([@labarba](https://github.com/labarba)) or someone on the [editorial board](http://jose.theoj.org/about#editorial_board) know and we will address it as soon as possible.
